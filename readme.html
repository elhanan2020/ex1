    <h2> Designe patern using </h2>
    <p>I use the factory type pattern design when I check what kind of order I received "i" "t" "w" ... and
        for each of these  orders I create an instance of the order received </p>
    <p>and i build the class that check if a html page is in some language in a form that is very simply to check in
        other language than english,all what we need is to provide his frequency table </p>
<p>
    to recognize in which language an html page was written I use the second proposed algorithm and I apply it as follows:
    <br>
    I count the number of times that each letter of the alphabet appears and I divide the number of each letter by the total
    <br>
    letter number then the result of each letter subtracts the frequency of each letter in the English language and up it in square
    <br>
    that I if the final result does not exceed 0.004 so I can consider that the page was written in English
</p>
<h2>NOTE:</h2>
for the "t" code in the exercisse page there an exemple like "t https://cs.hac.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat.png <u style="color:red">img</u>" that need to  return  true
    <br>
    but in the reality ze need to enter this command "t https://cs.hac.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat.png <u style="color:red">image</u>"
